You might ask why blog post is not in Uzbek language if it's intended for Uzbek students?
This is a question many of you may ask. There are several reasons for that. First off, you improve your English language skill. Also, as you are applying for European universities, you need to have a better understanding of English. If you have, then you can consider contributing to this project in translating it in different languages (like Uzbek or Russian). 

However, if you lack skills in English language, you will improve it along the way. It will be like shooting two rabbits with one shot. Both practising 
you English skill and learning something new from previous students.

Moreover, this project will be intended for all students at Riga Technical University in the long-run. 
Therefore, we could help students all over the world by delivering our best support to them.
