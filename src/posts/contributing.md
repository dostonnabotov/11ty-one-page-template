Student Guide is a free project that I maintain in my spare time. Needless to say, it is quite a large amount of work to keep everything up-to-date, documented and relevant.

Now if you feel like contributing, you can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/dostonnabotov/student-guide). 

Last, but not least, please, do consider that spreading the word, supporting in the translation part or even fixing a tiny typo by opening an issue or a pull-request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dostonnabotov/student-guide) are much appreciated!
