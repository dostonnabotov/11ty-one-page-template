This idea suddenly popped up to my mind when I was coding along this project. It basically describes how university life can be 
divided into 3 parts, which are *prior, during and after*. 

**Prior** mainly focuses on the period that happens before university life. Applying for a university, gathering documents, 
what to do when you get rejected or accepted can be a great example.

**During** (as you might have guessed) focuses on the period where you spend most of time, which is of course the university itself.
It provides you with the data that might help you to "succeed" at university. This is where you get most of information on exams, studies, daily habits for succcessfully completing the course and so on. 

**After** is currently in progress... Becuase I haven't have completed my Bachelor's yet. However, I hope that our senior brothers can help with that. Also, if you are a graduate (the one who has completed this Bachelor's), you are very welcome to share your thoughts and insights that you had after university.

Ok, with that short summary of each stage, let's dive deeper and explore more about them!
