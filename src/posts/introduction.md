Hi, there! Welcome to Riga Technical University (RTU) and to my blog!

I am a second-year student at Riga Technical University. I love software and technology. As I am currently developing my skills on frontend web development, I decided to make a blog, so I could share my knowledge and experience with others. Just like other blog posts, this one is also intended to help people to learn at least something new.

**'Student Guide'** (as its name clearly states) is created for students to guide them in their prior, during and after university life. Despite not finishing my studies yet, I had a great deal of experience prior and during my university life, ranging from collecting documents to how to prepare for mid-term and final exams.

I hope you enjoy my blog and will find something interesting and useful in it!

> **<span style="color: #ffa500">Spoilers alert! </span>** This blog is intended for Uzbek students, who would like to apply for Latvia Universities for now. However, I hope that as our blog becomes popular, we can extend it further on.
