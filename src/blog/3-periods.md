I recently came up with an idea while creating this blog. The idea was mainly to broaden the horizon of upcoming students on university. You might wonder and say _what is the point of it?_. Then, I decided to make some changes and do little bit research, and finally named as **3 university periods**.

What it means that I decided to explain university life in 3 stages, through which any student would get an idea of what is going on university and how to make it through. With that, I called the first stage/period **Before**. As its meaning clearly says what it is, this stage will mostly focus on the period prior to university. Let's us take a look at several examples:

- which university to apply?
- how to apply?
- application process
- what are requirements?
- do I really need IELTS to enroll in university?
- gathering documents
- tuition fee and scholarships
- and, more...

In the next stage, we will diving deep into university student life. As you might have guessed, I named this stage as **During**. What we will mainly consider in this period is that students' university life stories, tests, mid-terms exams, final exams, preparations and all other university and study related stuffs.

And, the final stage, called as **After**, mostly emphasize on the period after the university. Of course, I haven't graduated the university, yet. However, as I mentioned in the **Contributing** section, graduated students will be sharing their own stories on how did they make it through, what challenges and rewards we will be facing soon and other valuable lessons. Be sure to thanks them!

I hope that you get at least the idea of what I meant my **3 university periods**. With a little bit of understanding, let's take a closer look to each one of them, so that we could implement them in our own university periods.
