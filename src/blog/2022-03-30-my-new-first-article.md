*3.30.2022*, at *10:30*, **the Whale Library** site is born. I am very happy with that. I created this blog with the help of Kevin Powell, who has helped me a lot in learning from the fundamentals of web development to advanced features. If you want to know how I created this blog, you can watch his video on YouTube. Just [click here](https://youtu.be/4wD00RT6d-g). I hope that it is just the beginning because there is more coming. 

Let me tell you the secret that I and my friend are keeping. The **Whale** is the company that we are intending to run in the upcoming future. To be honest, there is no purpose for the company yet. I mean, we aren't sure enough about what does our company do. However, we are mostly *focusing on* serving our company as a multi-purpose company, which can serve different purposes at the same time. In other words, some sectors of the company will be for car manufacturing, and the other sectors will be focusing on decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the air, or simply serving *zero-emission purposes*.

Yet, we are still learning, exploring, and discovering new things that not only could contribute to changing the world into a better place to live, but also develop AI that could share the same interests and feelings as humans. And, it would be insane if the latter one could happen.

I think, that's for it. Sorry I have made some mistakes with grammar or sentence structure. Hopefully, I haven't made that much as I am using 'Grammarly' app.

All in all, the **Whale Library** is born and here live from ***TODAY***!!!
