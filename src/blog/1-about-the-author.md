Hi, there. My name is [Doston Nabotov](https://github.com/dostonnabotov/). Currently, I am a first-year Computer Science student at **Riga Technical University**. It hasn't been long time since I started my university life in Riga. Of course, except for online classes and commuting to the library everyday, everything is great.

I created this blog to share what I have been through up until now. By the way, these all ideas are not only from me, but also previously graduated and current students at RTU. I decided to ask for help regarding sharing their experience and stories with me. And, I am here to share it with you, guys.

I hope that the '**Student Guide**' will help you to get through the university, ranging from how to apply and what to consider while applying to university student life and how to deal with exams and tests.

Hope that you enjoy it!
