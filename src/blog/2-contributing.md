Student Guide is a free project that I maintain in my spare time. Needless to say, it is quite a large amount of work to keep everything up-to-date, documented and relevant.

Now if you feel like contributing, please know that contributing, spreading the word, or fixing a tiny typo by opening an issue or a pull-request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dostonnabotov/student-guide) would be great!

Last, but not least, please, do consider sharing this blog with others, so that others also can get benefits and do not make mistakes that you and we made. So, with that, let's get started!
